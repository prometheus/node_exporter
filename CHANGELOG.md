## master / unreleased

**Breaking changes**

This release contains more breaking changes:
* Rename label `node` of metric `node_cpu_package_throttles_total` to `package`.
* Add 2nd label `package` to metric `node_cpu_core_throttles_total`.

* [CHANGE]
* [FEATURE]
* [ENHANCEMENT]
* [BUGFIX] Count core throttles per core and per package #871

## 0.16.0-rc.1 / 2018-04-04

**Breaking changes**

This release contains major breaking changes to metric names.  Many metrics have new names, labels, and label values in order to conform to current naming conventions.
* Linux node_cpu metrics now break out `guest` values into separate metrics.  See Issue #737
* Many counter metrics have been renamed to include `_total`.
* Many metrics have been renamed/modified to include base units, for example `node_cpu` is now `node_cpu_seconds_total`.

In order to help with backwards compatibility, a `metric_relabel_config` is being worked on to allow for easier transition of metric names.  See: https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/issues/830

Other breaking changes:
* The megacli collector has been removed, is now replaced by the storcli.py textfile helper.

## 0.15.0 / 2017-10-06

**Breaking changes**

This release contains major breaking changes to flag handling.
* The flag library has been changed, all flags now require double-dashs. (`-foo` becomes `--foo`).
* The collector selection flag has been replaced by individual boolean flags.
* The `-collector.procfs` and `-collector.sysfs` flags have been renamed to `--path.procfs` and `--path.sysfs` respectively.

The `ntp` collector has been replaced with a new NTP-based check that is designed to expose the state of a localhost NTP server rather than provide the offset of the node to a remote NTP server.  By default the `ntp` collector is now locked to localhost.  This is to avoid accidental spamming of public internet NTP pools.

Windows support is now removed, the [wmi_exporter](https://github.com/martinlindhe/wmi_exporter) is recommended as a replacement.
